    <h2>Garrett Little</h2>
    <p>As stated above, my name is Garrett Little. I am 20 years old. I am a Junior here at BYU-I. My major is Computer Science. I am originally from Houston Texas. Since being in Rexburg, I decided I don't ever want to move back because I enjoy the weather MUCH more here! I work at the Madison Hospital as a Housekeeping Aid.    </p>
    <p>Overall, I have enjoyed my few years here in Rexburg SO much, and I'm excited to be here in this class!</p>
